            <p>My name is Jugraj Chouhan, and after 5 years of high school I have come to BCIT with only one goal, to
                make a
                future for myself in the IT department.</p>
            <p>I live in Surrey BC with my mother and sister, and as of right now I am
                <strong>overwhelmed</strong> with the amount of work <em>some</em> professors are assigning. I spend my
            </p>
            <p>free time playing video games or
                at the gym, I also enjoy just hanging out with my friends at the mall or playing sports with them.</p>
            <p> Here are some of the courses I am taking right now
            <ul>
                <li>Database Systems</li>
                <li>Techincal Math for IT</li>
                <li>Scripting for IT</li>
            </ul>
