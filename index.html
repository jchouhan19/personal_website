    <h1>My name is Jugraj</h1>
    <h2> What do you want to know?</h2>
    <p>My name is Jugraj Chouhan, and after 5 years of high school I have come to BCIT with only one goal, to make a
        future for myself in the IT department.<br>I live in Surrey BC with my mother and sister, and as of right now I am
       <strong>overwhelmed</strong> with the amount of work <em>some</em> professors are assigning. I spend my<br>free time playing video games or
        at the gym, I also enjoy just hanging out with my friends at the mall or playing sports with them.<br></p>
<p> Here are some of the courses I am taking right now
    <ul>
        <li>Database Systems</li>
        <li>Techincal Math for IT</li>
        <li>Scripting for IT</li>
    </ul>
